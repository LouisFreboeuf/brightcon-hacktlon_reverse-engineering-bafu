# Check: Compressed air, average generation, <30kW, 10 bar gauge, at compressor (f629fb08-0ad6-387e-a846-cb9bb1af25a9)

target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `f629fb08-0ad6-387e-a846-cb9bb1af25a9-bench-disagg` and hybrid `f629fb08-0ad6-387e-a846-cb9bb1af25a9-bench-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: Tab. 10.14 'Unit process raw data of the datasets "compressed air, average generation, <30kW, at compressor"', 10 bar gauge column [RER], per 1 m3; allocation: none stated. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** none
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 22/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 13.5%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 30.8% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1782 flows of the target, 1666 are determined by the solve (116 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 907 of those 1666 within ±10 % (54%), median |Δ| 7.6%, 0 missing from the model, 1 extra
- hybrid vs target: identical on every flow

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 10 % | 910 | 51% |
| 10–20 % | 195 | 11% |
| 20–50 % | 457 | 26% |
| 50–100 % | 135 | 8% |
| > 100 % | 85 | 5% |
