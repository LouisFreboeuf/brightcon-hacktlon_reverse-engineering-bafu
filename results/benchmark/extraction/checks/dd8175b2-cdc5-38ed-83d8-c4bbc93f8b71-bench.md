# Check: Grain maize IP, at feed mill (dd8175b2-cdc5-38ed-83d8-c4bbc93f8b71)

target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `dd8175b2-cdc5-38ed-83d8-c4bbc93f8b71-bench-disagg` and hybrid `dd8175b2-cdc5-38ed-83d8-c4bbc93f8b71-bench-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: Chapter 12 'Feedstuffs': Tab. 12.2 for the production-process shares, Tab. 12.3 (Maize row) for the transport distances and section 12.2.3 for the processing energy (35 kWh electricity and 4 m3 natural gas per tonne of feedstuff). Per 1 kg of feedstuff at the feed mill.; allocation: none stated. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** none
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 36/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 2.6%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 97.6% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1782 flows of the target, 1668 are determined by the solve (114 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 1292 of those 1668 within ±10 % (77%), median |Δ| 1.9%, 0 missing from the model, 0 extra
- hybrid vs target: identical on every flow

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 10 % | 1295 | 73% |
| 10–20 % | 180 | 10% |
| 20–50 % | 157 | 9% |
| 50–100 % | 74 | 4% |
