target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `bcd8ea60-8d17-34e2-8e4b-300c20eaa2f4-bench-disagg` and hybrid `bcd8ea60-8d17-34e2-8e4b-300c20eaa2f4-bench-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: Figure 20 'Unit process raw data of canning of food', column 'Canning of legumes' [CH], per 1 kg; allocation: none stated. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** none
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 50/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 0.0%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 100.0% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1792 flows of the target, 1669 are determined by the solve (123 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 1669 of those 1669 within ±10 % (100%), median |Δ| 0.0%, 0 missing from the model, 0 extra
- hybrid vs target: identical on every flow

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 10 % | 1702 | 95% |
| 10–20 % | 5 | 0% |
| 20–50 % | 52 | 3% |
| 50–100 % | 4 | 0% |
| > 100 % | 29 | 2% |
