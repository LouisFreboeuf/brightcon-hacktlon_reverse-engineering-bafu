# Check: Acetone, liquid, at plant (f44d9ac3-f0cb-311d-bdba-3fd3946b573c)

target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `f44d9ac3-f0cb-311d-bdba-3fd3946b573c-draft-disagg` and hybrid `f44d9ac3-f0cb-311d-bdba-3fd3946b573c-draft-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: per 1000 kg of acetone, the basis of the only quantitative statement in the chapter (sec. 1.5.2, citing Wells 1999); allocation: None. Acetone and phenol are co-products of the cumene process - 'Acetone and phenol are co-products and their production and demand are intertwined' - and the excerpt states that the cumene figure excludes the phenol ('The production of the co-product phenol is not included in this figure'), i.e. 100 % of the cumene is charged to the acetone. No burden is shifted to phenol here either.. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** none
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 1/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 123.6%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 0.0% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1782 flows of the target, 1677 are determined by the solve (105 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 1 of those 1677 within ±10 % (0%), median |Δ| 35890.9%, 11 missing from the model, 0 extra
- hybrid vs target: 6 flows differ

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
