# Check: Titanium dioxide at plant, sulphate process, at plant (f29ea928-dad4-33fe-ac09-33391c25e0ae)

target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `f29ea928-dad4-33fe-ac09-33391c25e0ae-draft-disagg` and hybrid `f29ea928-dad4-33fe-ac09-33391c25e0ae-draft-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: per 1 kg of TiO2; Tab. 85.3 'Kg per kg of product', Tab. 85.4 'Consumption per kg of product (MJ/kg)', Tab. 85.6 and Tab. 85.8 'Gram per kg of product'. The SULFATE-process column is used.; allocation: none stated; the report notes filter salts 'that are produced can be sold' but gives no allocation. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** Sulphuric acid, liquid, at plant [2.4–3.5], xxx Electricity, medium voltage, production UCTE, at grid [0.619–1.41], Heat, natural gas, at industrial furnace 1MW [10.4–24.2], Natural gas, burned in industrial furnace 1MW [9.67–16.2], Hard coal, burned in industrial furnace 1-10MW [5.8–8.5]
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 11/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 36.9%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 13.3% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1148 flows of the target, 1148 are determined by the solve (0 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 117 of those 1148 within ±10 % (10%), median |Δ| 74.8%, 0 missing from the model, 626 extra
- hybrid vs target: identical on every flow

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
