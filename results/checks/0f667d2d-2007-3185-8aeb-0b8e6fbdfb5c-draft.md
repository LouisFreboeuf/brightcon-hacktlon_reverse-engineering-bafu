# Check: Hydrogen cyanide, at plant (0f667d2d-2007-3185-8aeb-0b8e6fbdfb5c)

target `bafu-2026` vs explicit model `0f667d2d-2007-3185-8aeb-0b8e6fbdfb5c-draft-disagg` and hybrid `0f667d2d-2007-3185-8aeb-0b8e6fbdfb5c-draft-hybrid`

**Strategy:** S1 — transcription drafted from the report excerpt by the LLM pipeline (reverse-bafu draft). basis: per kg of hydrogen cyanide, Tab. 43.2 / 43.3 / 43.4 of chapter 43 of ecoinvent report No. 8 (Althaus et al. 2007), all printed per kg or per kg in grams; allocation: None stated. The chapter reports three co-products per kg HCN - 0.23 kg hydrogen (BMA route, if not burnt), 0.34 kg ammonium sulfate sold as fertiliser and 0.02 kg sodium cyanide - but gives no allocation factor, so every burden below stays with the HCN.; 3 of 4 inputs carry a printed amount, 1 a printed range, 0 no number in the report. Review every derivation; unreviewed entries have reviewed_by = null.
**Calibrated inputs:** Heat, natural gas, at industrial furnace 1MW [23.2–35.4]
**Links to rebuilt nodes:** none

## Flow agreement (explicit vs target, per elementary flow)

- the 50 largest kilogram flows: 1/50 within ±10 %, median |Δ| 97.6%
- kilogram mass covered within ±10 %: 0.1% of the target's total kg mass
- of the 1773 flows of the target, 1668 are determined by the solve (105 are round-off and are not scored; see lci.determined_flows)
- 6 of those 1668 within ±10 % (0%), median |Δ| 11380.3%, 0 missing from the model, 1 extra
- hybrid vs target: 3 flows differ

| \|Δ\| bucket | flows | share of target flows |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 10 % | 6 | 0% |
| 10–20 % | 5 | 0% |
