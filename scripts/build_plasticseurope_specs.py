"""Write the hand-drafted S2/S3 specs for the PlasticsEurope family of BAFU-2026.

Run:  PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/build_plasticseurope_specs.py

Why a script and not 11 JSON files typed out: every amount in these specs is derived from one of a
small number of quoted lines (a stoichiometric equation, a yield range, an allocation factor, the
ecoinvent standard transport distances), and the derivation has to stay visible next to the number.
The script is the derivation; the JSON it writes carries the quote in every ``note``.

Nothing here reads the target's own flow vector. What the specs take from BAFU-2026 itself is
structure from *other* datasets used as named templates (Diethylene glycol, PET amorphous,
Emulsion polymerisation) - never the target.

    "chemical plant per *dataset*, i.e. one for a whole cradle-to-gate chain, while this model links to a precursor "
    "dataset that already carries its own 4.0E-10 - so a second one is a double count against the target's own "
    "convention. That matters more than its size suggests: of the 1790 flows in the cumulative vector of every one "
    "of these 14 datasets, 1316 get more than 90 % of their value from this single exchange (see "

    "amounts out of the target would be reading the answer. Adding the whole Tab. 3.1 candidate list as free "
    "inputs was tested on Ethylene glycol - the fit drove all eleven to ~1e-12 and the agreement did not move "
