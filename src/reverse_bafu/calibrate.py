"""Step 2 - amounts for the inputs marked ``free``, by bounded least squares against the target's
cumulative inventory, flow by flow, with every other input held at its spec amount. The input
*list* is never changed here: with a free structure the fit reproduces the inventory and invents
the process (see the method explainer in artifacts/, §2 and §7); with the list fixed it recovers
amounts to ~10 %.

No impact assessment: every flow present in the target or the model is one equation, weighted by
its relative error, with each (unit, compartment) group of flows carrying the same total weight
(``lci.System.fit_weights``). There is no per-category emphasis to choose."""
